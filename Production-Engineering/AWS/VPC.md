# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
On EC2, you can deploy to the EC2 classic network or a custom VPC.

**A VPC** is a logically isolated section of AWS with its own IP address range. It consists of subnets, route tables, security groups
- subnets are segments of the VPC's address range (written as CIDR) that live entirely in a single availability zone
- a **route table** is a logical construct within the VPC
