# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
Compute is the amount of resources (Memory, CPU, Network Performance, Storage) required to fulfill a workload. EC2 is Amazon's offering for compute. There are many flavors that offer different combinations of resources optimized for different kinds of tasks.
- **Amazon Machine Images (AMI)** are the inital state for EC2 instances (snapshot of computer state)
- security groups act as a firewall for inbound (and outbound) network traffic
- storage is emphemeral unless an Elastic Block Storage Volume (EBS) is mounted
- three instance types: on-demand, reserved and spot
- spot instances are cheapest and are purchased based on highest bidding customers, which means machines can be shut down at any time based on market demand
