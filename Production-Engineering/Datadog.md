# Datadog
Recieves lots of metrics and events from applications and services, providing dashboards, alerts and metrics.
- visualizes monitoring data and creates alerts based on it
- Has two types of data: **events*** and **metrics**
  - events are infrequent significant events (deploys, restarts)
  - metrics are frequent, interested in aggregating over time
  - events are sent to Datadog using HTTP-based API
