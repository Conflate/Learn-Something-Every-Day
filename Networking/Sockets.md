# Sockets
### Unix Sockets
Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.
- know that they're running on the same machine, so they can omit checks otherwise done by TCP/IP sockets like NAT routing
- *don't have to go through 

### IP Sockets (TCP/IP)
Mechanism enabling inter-process communication over the network (or same computer using the loopback interface)
- more overhead as they require multiple steps for the TCP protocol
