# CS138 UWaterloo, Introduction to Data Abstraction and Implementation
### Some History

Unix and C developed in 1970s at Bell Labs/AT&T 

Linux 1990s open source

### File Permissions:

Each file/directory has three sets of permissions: userID, unix group, everyone else with r,w,x

First is d (directory) or - (file) 

`chgrp` changes group name, `chmod` changes permissions 

(0--- 1--x 2-w- 3-wx 4r-- 5r-x 6rw- 7rwx)

Timeline: FORTRAN, COBOL, C, C++, Java …

### Memory Model
Run-time Stack: manages the storage needed locally for each function call

Heap: freestore for dynamically allocated objects (new, malloc)

### Data Structures
struct instances: `strctName s;` direct instantiation on run-time stack (doesn’t work for passing around linked structures)

`strctName* sPtr = new strctName;` dynamic instantiation, on the heap until deleted

**Abstract data type (ADT)**: mathematical structure with well defined behavior (operations)
- signature describes params, pre-cond specifies assumptions before operation, post-condition describes effect of operation

**Adapter:** implementing one ADT with another, unifying the API

**Linked List:** nodes to implement a sequence

**Stack:** ordered data container, LIFO

**Queue:** FIFO

**Priority Queue:** a queue of objects with an integer priority attribute. usually implemented as a list-of-lists (good for lots of elements, few priorities) or a heap, its a binary tree, s.t. for each node, its children have lesser value than itself (better for lots of priorities)

**Binary Tree:** each node has two children

**Binary Search Tree:** each left child is less than the node, each right child is greater

lookup traverses, insert does lookup and adds where it should be

inorder traversal is DFS, print using recursion

deleting, only complex if 2 children: replace node with largest in left or smallest in right

**Sequence:** abstract data type, container of elements indexed by a set of contiguous integers
- known as vectors or lists

**Dictionary:** ADT, collection of ordered pairs of form key => val

`include <map>` gives access to `map<string, int> m`

**Hash Table:** vector of k buckets, `vector<studentRecord> hashTable(k)`

**Hash Function:** takes key value, calculates its index

### Map (Dictionary)
The C++ `map` data type implements the idea of dictionaries. 
- ordered (sorted) container 
- declaration: `map<T1, T2> m;` where T1 is the **key** and T2 is the **value**.
- The key must have a strict weak ordering, with `<` function (strings, numbers, pointers)
- maintains sorted elements using red-black tree (self balancing tree with O(log N) insert, delete, lookup)

```C++
map<string, int> m;
string token;
while(cin >> token) { // count number of times each word appears
    m[token]++;
}
m.erase("some_key"); // removes key "some_key" from the map
```

### Hash Functions
Converts some data to an index in the range [0..K-1], K is number of slots.
Important Characteristics of Hash Functions:
1. Deterministic based on key (always get same answer from same input)
2. Uniform spread over buckets/slots.
3. Cheap to compute.
4. Supports a variable range (as K scales)

Hashing does not require unique keys, however same keys will map to same place causng collision.

Hashing doesn't work well for ordered operations (like print in alphabetical order) since similar keys should map to wildly different locations.

Example: Human names have poor distribution (lots of S's, few X's)
- common hash is sum ASCII values mod K. (Still terrible, does not scale with num of buckets K)

### Hash Table Structure
Consists of vector, hash function, collision strategy.

Can insert, delete, lookup in amortized O(1) constant time. 
- **hash table** is a vector of k slots/buckets 
- **hash function** is a deterministic algorithm for matching a given key to an index [0..k-1]
- a good hashing function reduces chance of collisions. 

#### Closed Hashing
Also known as open addressing, uses **linear probing** (adding one and trying again):
- initialize the HashTable with N nodes set to `EMPTY` status
- Allocate all space for the table at the beginning (Vector of nodes, with key, value and statuses: `EMPTY`, `ZOMBIE`, `ACTIVE`)
- insert: hash the key, if index is taken, increment through the allocated vector until an empty (or zombie) bucket is found. Sets node to `ACTIVE`
- lookup: hash key, increment through the vector until key is found (return val) or empty bucket is found (return -1) or all buckets have been checked (return -1).
- remove: lookup key, set status of node to ZOMBIE
- if N << K this works well (at cost of space)

Issues:
- As table reaches limit, `insert` approaches O(N)
- If table has few EMPTY slots, `lookup` and `remove` approaches O(N)

#### Open Hashing
Each slot has a bucket of elements. Hash Table is a list-of-lists, called **open hashing with chaining**.

With K buckets and N records:
- Best case: no collisions, O(1) lookup
- Worst case: all inputs hash to same index, O(N) lookup

### Object Oriented Programming
Syntax is well explained using code:
```C++
Balloon b;
Balloon *pb = new Balloon;
class Balloon : public ParentClass{     // class declaration, with parent, in .h file
    public:
        Balloon(); // constructor
        Balloon(string colour); // constructor with parameter
        virtual ~Balloon();     // allows for redefinition in derived classes
        getColour() const ; // constant method, cannot change object
        static balloon_counter; // class variable
    private:
        string colour;
};
// Method definitions, in .cc file
Balloon::Balloon () {
    this->colour = “clear”;
}
Balloon::Balloon (string colour){
    this->colour = colour;
}
Balloon::Balloon(string colour) : ParentClass(), colour(colour) {}     // shorthand syntax, stops double instantiation of object parameters, calls parent constructor

Balloon::~Balloon (){}     // destructor
```

### Abstract Base Class
Cannot be instantiated, contains many virtual methods, so that children (inheritance) have consistent API for polymorphism

`Protected` describes private elements, available to children. ABCs should have constructors in protected, ABCs need ctors for children to be instantiated
