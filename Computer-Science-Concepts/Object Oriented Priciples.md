# Object Oriented Programming
## OO Terminology
**Member Variable field**:
- an instance variable (one per instance of class)
- A class/`static` variable (one per class)

**Member Method**:
- instance method (operates on `this` (C++/Java) or `self` (python, Ruby) object 
- class/`static` method (called on the Class, not instance)

- Instance variables are created for each instance object
- A `static` variable or class variable only exists once.
