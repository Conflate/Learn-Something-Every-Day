# 1 Classes of Problems in Machine Learning
## 1.0 Machine Learning Overview
- Evolved from AI, new capability for computers
- Database mining (web click data, medical records, biology, engineering)
- Robotics, handwriting recognition, self-customizing programs

**Formal Definition**: program learns from experience E with respect to class of tasks T and performance measure P, if performance (P) at tasks in T improve with experience (E)

## 1.1 Supervised Learning
- Given data set, with intended output, produce right answer
- Regression problem, output of continuous values
- Linear approximation and taylor polynomial
- Classification problem, determine probability of a discrete valued output (0,1) 

## 1.2 Unsupervised Learning
- Given data set, not necessarily with knowledge of the data, find some structure to data (clustering of data)
- Algorithm will discover conclusive information and structure from data
- Ex: Cocktail party algorithm, takes audio inputs of two speakers, separate to independent files
- Octave is a language tailored well to Machine Learning.

## 1.3 Linear Regression One Var
Map inputs to continuous outputs. Hypothesis function is of the form of linear approximation.
