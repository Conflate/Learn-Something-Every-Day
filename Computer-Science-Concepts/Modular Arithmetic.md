## Congruence
Definition: Let a,b be integers, n is a Natural number. Then a is congruent to b modulo n iff n | (a-b).

Or "b is the remainder when you do integer division of a % n".

#### Congruence is an Equivalence Relation (CER)
Let n be Natural. Let a,b,c be Integers. Then
a ≡ a (mod n)
a ≡ b (mod n) => b ≡ a (mod n)
(Transitivity) a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n) => a ≡ c (mod n)
