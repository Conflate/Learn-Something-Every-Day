# API 
Application-Programming Interface (API) describes the set of methods, tools, routines and protocols set out by a library, package, or software applicaiton. An API for the Java Math library describes the method names and their parameters like `Math.pow(int, int)`.

## Good API Design
- should be easy to learn and use
- hard to misuse
- Simplicity is better for early API design.
