This is just a list of facinating or otherwise useful blogs/articles that I've read, and my takeaway from them.

### [Being a senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
- engineering maturity is more than technical growth, and is highly correlative to one's willingness to work with others, empathetically and selflessly
- giving and recieving criticism is vital for thriving in engineering, but is a fine-line between baseless complaints and assertive and constructive critque 
  - it is important to give feedback on work, while avoiding personal critique
  - it is important to receive criticism humbly

### [Trump, Putin and the Pipelines to Nowhere](https://medium.com/@AlexSteffen/trump-putin-and-the-pipelines-to-nowhere-742d745ce8fd#.b3ylhhvrt)
- This article has some biases in my opinion, and is strongly a persuasive piece
- disregarding a lot of political slandering, I do think it brings up interesting points of economic dependence on perception
  - markets and stock prices are a complex amalgamation public perception, parametrically dependent on confidence, future prospects, and current financial valuations
  - as an aside, a tech company's valuation is often the company's future prospects, and by association its growth. A valuation is not strongly based on current financial statistics, but rather projected values
