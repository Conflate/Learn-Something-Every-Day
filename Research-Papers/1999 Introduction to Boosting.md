# [A Short Introduction to Boosting](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yfreund/papers/IntroToBoosting.pdf)
Boosting is a general method of producing a very accurate prediction rule by combining inaccurate rough rules
- boosting Probably approximately correct learning models (PAC)
  - PAC models find efficient functions, bound to polynomial time/space with respect to the example size
- AdaBoost: takes a set of (xi, yi) ... (xm,ym), xi in domain/instance space X and labels yi in set Y
  - simple case is Y = {-1, 1}, binary categorization
