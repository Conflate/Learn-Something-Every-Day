# [Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)
The fundamental goal of machine learning is to construct a function that can generalize beyond examples in the training data
- a learning problem can abstractly be broken down into three components: Representation Evaluation Optimization
- *No free lunch theorem* implies that a learning algorithms don't apply to random vector functions 
- Overfitting - the learner should perform equally against testing data and new data, otherwise it is overfit 
- Multi testing problem - so many hypotheses tests that it is statistically probable that there are anomalies
