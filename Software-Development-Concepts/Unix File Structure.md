# Unix File Structure
Single rooted tree at `/`. Instead of separate trees (as with disk partitioning), volumes can be *mounted* on a directory. Two-disk setups used to be common, with first disk with startup programs and second mounted as `/usr`.

### `/bin`
Contains binaries, including fundamental utilities like `ls` and `cp` used to mount `/usr`
