# Hooks
Hooking describes a range of techniques for altering behaviour of some software component by intercepting function calls, message or events passed between software components.
- debugging
- extending functionality 
- intercepting hardware events (mouse clicks)

### Callback
A callback is a piece of executable code passed as an argument to be called back later.
- implemented as subroutines, lambda expressions, function pointers
- synchronous callbacks called in the function code
- deferred callbacks called after the function returns

### Webhooks
Method of altering behaviour of web pages/applications with custom callbacks made with HTTP POST
- triggered by events like pushing code, comments in a blog
