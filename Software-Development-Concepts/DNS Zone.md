# DNS Zone
Any distinct contiguous portion of the domain name space in the Domain Name System. 

The domain name space of the Internet is a hierarchy of subdomains below the DNS root domain. Individual domains serve as delagation points. It is desirable to implement fine grained boundaries of delegation, so sub-levels of a domain can be managed independently.
