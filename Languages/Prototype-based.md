# Prototype Based Programming 
Rather than classes, prototype-oriented languages do inheritance by copying another object (the prototype) and adding attributes and methods to it; objects inherit from other objects. 
- Objects are generally completely mutable during runtime, unlike many class based object-oriented systems like Ruby. 
- generally interpreted and dynamically typed
- objects inherit directly from other objects through a prototype property
- object contruction can happen **ex nihilo** or through **cloning**

**Delegation** refers to taking a property or method of a receiving object and evaluating it in the context of the original sending object. 

Inheritance is performed using existing objects as a prototype for new ones.
