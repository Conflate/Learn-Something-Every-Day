# Functional Programming
It is a declarative programming paradigm (based on expression instead of statements), that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, while avoiding changing state and mutable data.

In functional programming, a functions output is dependent only on the parameters (deterministic?). This is one of the key motivations behind functional programming.

### Lambda Calculus
Mathematical abstraction that provides theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluation.

### First-class functions and pure functions
See [first-class functions](../CS-and-Math-Theory/Relations and Functions.md#First-class and higher-order functions) and [pure functions](../CS-and-Math-Theory/Relations and Functions.md#Pure Functions (expressions))
