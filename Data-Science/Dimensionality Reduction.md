# Dimensionality Reduction
MNIST is a computer vision dataset, classic example is the set of handwritten digits
- digit can be represented as a point in 784-dimensional space
- MNIST digits intuitively live in a lower dimensional subspace than 784
- goal of dimensionality reduction is to think of other ways to encode information in lower dimensions, losing only irrelevent information -- [source](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/)
  - **principal component analysis**: applying orthogonal tranformations to convert a set of correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables, called principle components
