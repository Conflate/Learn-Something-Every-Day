# Batch Processing
Is an efficient way of processing high volumes of data where a group of transactions is collected over a period of time. Data is collected and the processed in batches, returning a batch result (Hadoop is focused on batch data processing).

# Real Time Data Processing
Involves continual input, process and data output. (Radar systems, bank ATMs)
