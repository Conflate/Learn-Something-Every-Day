# Artificial neural network
A computational approach based on a collection of neural units connected by axons.
- each neural unit holds a function of all of it's inputs, whose output is propagated to other neural units
- typically consist of multiple layers or a cube design where signal path traverses from front to back

### Models
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are simple mathematical models defining `f: X -> Y` or a distribution over X or both X and Y
