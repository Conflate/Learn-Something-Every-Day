# Cluster Analysis
Set of many algorithms for completing the task of grouping objects with similiar properties
- popular notion of a cluster is a group with a small distance among the members, dense areas of the data space, or particular distributions
- can be phrased as a multi-objective optimization problem
- not an automated task, it's iterative knowledge discovery
