### k-means clustering
Partitioning `n` observations into `k` clusters, in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean
- NP-hard
- exist heuristic algorithms, that provide quicker computation, for an approximation
- tends to form clusters of comparable spatial extent
- expectation-maximization mechanism allows for different shapes
- aim to minimize the sum of square in each cluster
