### [Be Careful About What you Dislike](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/11/5/be-careful-about-what-you-dislike/)
Pretty interesting observations about general human sentiment, in technology and other social/global issues. It's not easy to reevaluate one's intrinsic beliefs about a topic, but perhaps the article is really suggesting to not shrug off opposing opinions; to consider and understand them rather than seeking affirmation of one's own beliefs from others around them.

Sort of interesting blurb on how best to ask for help in forums like stack overflow.

### [Varieties of Argumentative Experience](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/)
Articulation of what different levels of quality look like for arguments, ranging from actually refuting the central point to name-calling.
- one framework lists this as a hierarchy, including refutation, counterargument, contradiction, responding to tone, and attacking ethos
- another framework describes the existence of meta-debate; discussion about ethos, delivery of arguments, biases, social norms
- interestingly, different varieties of argument can be equally effective
- **bulverizing** is a logical fallacy where you try to prove by assuming the opponent is wrong by associating the validity of an argument with the ethos of the arguer
