### [Being a senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
- engineering maturity is more than technical growth, and is highly correlative to one's willingness to work with others, empathetically and selflessly
- giving and receiving criticism is vital for thriving in engineering, but is a fine-line between baseless complaints and assertive and constructive critique
  - it is important to give feedback on work, while avoiding personal critique
  - it is important to receive criticism humbly

### [Debugging Titles](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/debugging-titles-part-i) introduces further insight into job titles like senior engineer.
- describes pillars of engineering as programming, subject matter expertise, people leadership, craft leadership, product sense, delivery methods
- interesting that they introduce a well defined system for measuring these areas, it seems to be a guideline for growth towards "senior" rather than a definition
  - I think this system is really awesome for guiding growth, needs to be used carefully so as not to use it to compare oneself directly with others
  - if it's not done well though, you might undervalue certain members of the team accidentally, this system has to be holistic

### [An ambitious person's take on work life balance](https://medium.com/the-mission/an-ambitious-persons-take-on-work-life-balance-i-almost-lost-hope-in-my-marriage-b6f0c0355c2)
Retrospective on one person's life and how uncontrolled ambition retracted from other aspects of their life. They suggest to get the fundamentals right with a "marathon mentality", and constantly grow in six fundamental psychological and physiological areas:
- health, sleep, sanity and exercise
- wealth, investing gradually and being financially free
- relationships, having quality time and expressing love to friends and family
- work, having a fulfilling career that feeds ambition
- learning and growth, to never feel stagnation and to grow professionally and personally while expanding interests and reading books
- purpose, to define what's important to you, and tie all actions back to this purpose

Do not forgo ambition, but rather be patient with ambitious goals and be cautious sacrificing the fundamentals

### [The 5 hour rule](https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons/bill-gates-warren-buffett-and-oprah-all-use-the-5-hour-rule-308f528b6363)
It's the idea that many successful entrepreneurs follow, of having a set aside amount of time daily to learn and grow. This follows the previous article above nicely, in maintaining your fundamentals, one of which is learning. This is something I am strongly aligned with, as per the existence of this repository of thoughts and notes. By setting aside time every day to learn, you can ensure that stagnation will be avoided and you can see compounding effectiveness as you improve learning workflows. The article goes on further to say that others spend this 1-hour a day thinking about their mental models and perception of the world around them, while other's spend it experimenting with new ideas.
