### Central Tendency
the degree of clustering of values of a statistical distribution
- arithmetic mean is `(1/n)∑(yi)` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n
- median or geometric mean is `(y1•y2•...•yn)^(1/n)`
- harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals
- For any two #s, AM ≥ GM ≥ HM
- median is the middle element of a set
- Quartiles is splitting data into four equal parts
- Percentiles break data in to 100 parts
- Mode is the element of maximum frequency

### Measure of Dispersion
- Range = Max - min
- Variance = `σ^2`, the average of the squared deviations from the mean
  - for mean ȳ, `σ^2 = (1/(n-1)) ∑ (yi - ȳ)^2`
