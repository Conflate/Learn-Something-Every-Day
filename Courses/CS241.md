### Abstraction
- an **opcode** is a word that represents a machine language instruction (ADD, JR ... )
- **assembly language** is a lang for writing machine lang programs using opcodes instead of bits
- **assembler** is a program that translates assembly lang. into machine lang.
- **label** is an abstraction of a memory address (think variable assignment)
- instructions are words (strings of bits)
- a **code** can be a word for instructions or extra features like labels, that are not instructions
```sh
Find abs value of $1 (two's complement)
SLT(2,1,0)
beq(2, 0, label) # beq takes labels while BEQ takes offsets
SUB(1, 0, 1)
Define(label)
JR(31) # end the program
```
