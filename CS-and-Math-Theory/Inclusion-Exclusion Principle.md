# The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
The [sum principle](Counting.md#sum-principle) holds for disjoint sets. For non disjoint sets, we have the inequality: `|U Ai| ≤ ∑|Ai|` for i from 1 to n, of n sets A (Union of all sets is less than the sum of cardinalities). 

With more information, for sets A and B, `|A ∪ B| = |A|+|B| − |A ∩ B|`
