# Binomial Coefficients
nCk is the number of k-element subsets of n-elements. The quantites nCk are called *binomial coefficients* because of their role in the Binomial Theorem. 

Important identity: `nCk = nC(n-k)`. Choosing a k-element subset B from an n-element set uniquely identifies the complement A \ B of B in A, which is an (n-k)-subset of A.
