# The Pigeonhole Principle
If you put more than n pigeons into n pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole will have more than one pigeon.

Given two sets A and B, with |A| = m > n = |B|, for any function ƒ: A->B, there exists b in B s.t. `| {x in A: ƒ(x)=b} | > 1`. In general form, `| {x in A: ƒ(x)=b} | ≥ ceil(m/n)`. Dijkstra's form says for a nonempty finite collection of integers, the max value is at least the average value.
