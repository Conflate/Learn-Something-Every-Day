## Sets 
A *set* is an unordered colleciton of distinct objects. The objects in a set are *elements* or *members*.

Fields like the Natural numbers, Integers or Real numbers are all sets defined like {0,1,2, ...}.

#### Operations
- Union. A ∪ B = {x : x in A or x in B}
- Intersection. A ∩ B = {x : x in A and x in B}
- Difference. A \ B = {x : x in A and ¬ in B}
- Can be extended to multiple sets (like large sum notation ∑)
- Cardinality |A| is the *size* of A, number of elements.
- Subset. A ⊆ B = { for all x in A, x in B}
