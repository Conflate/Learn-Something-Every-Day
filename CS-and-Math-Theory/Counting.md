## Counting
Counting is **enumerative combinatorics**. For some set A, we wish to calculate the size |A| of A. Sample questions:
- How many ways are there to seat n couples at a round table?
- How many ways are there to express a positive integer n as a sum of positive integers?

#### Sum Principle
Consider n sets of Ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, that are *pairwise disjoint*, namely the intersection of Ai and Aj = ø for all i ≠ j.
