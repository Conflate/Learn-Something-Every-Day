### Gas Laws
- gas laws are equations relating Volume, moles, temperature and pressure of gases
  - `V = f(n,T,P)`
  - Ideal gas law states `PV = nRT`, R is a gas constant, which can be expressed in many combinations of units
- pressure is force per area, the collision of gas against a wall of a container
  - measured in Newtons per m^2 (Pascal)
- Boyle's Law is the relationship between pressure and volume for fixed amount of gas ( constant `nRT`)
- Law of Charles 
- absolute temperature (Kelvin) is used for gas relationships

### Dalton's Law
- different types of gases in a mixture act independently from each other
- this introduces partial pressures, each gas has it's own mol value and pressure value for constant V and T
  - partial pressures are additive, the pressure exerted on a container by the gas independently 
- partial pressure can be used for molar fractions (what percentage of the mixture does the given gas make up for?)

### Kinetic Theory of Gases
- a model for gas behaviour, provides theoretical justification for ideal gas law
  - states a gas is composed of lots of particles in constant, random motion
  - gas is mostly empty space
  - molecules collide with others or walls
  - no intermolecular forces, other than collisions
  - molecules gain or lose energy during elastic collisions, but net energy remains constant
- translational kinetic energy: `ek = (1/2)• m • u^2` (`u` is velocity)
- frequency of collision: `f ∝ u • (N / V)`
- momentum transfer to wall: `µ ∝ m • u`
- Gas pressure: `P ∝ µ • f ∝ (m•u)•u•(N/V) ∝ mu^2•(N/V)`
- then, assuming all molecules have the same speed, we can approximate: `P = (1/3)mu^2(N/V)`, where u is the rms speed
