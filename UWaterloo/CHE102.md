### Gas Laws
- gas laws are equations relating Volume, moles, temperature and pressure of gases
  - `V = f(n,T,P)`
  - Ideal gas law states `PV = nRT`, R is a gas constant, which can be expressed in many combinations of units
- pressure is force per area, the collision of gas against a wall of a container
  - measured in Newtons per m^2 (Pascal)
- Boyle's Law is the relationship between pressure and volume for fixed amount of gas ( constant `nRT`)
- Law of Charles 
- absolute temperature (Kelvin) is used for gas relationships

### Dalton's Law
- different types of gases in a mixture act independently from each other
- this introduces partial pressures, each gas has it's own mol value and pressure value for constant V and T
  - partial pressures are additive, the pressure exerted on a container by the gas independently 
- partial pressure can be used for molar fractions (what percentage of the mixture does the given gas make up for?)

### Kinetic Theory of Gases
- a model for gas behaviour, provides theoretical justification for ideal gas law
  - states a gas is composed of lots of particles in constant, random motion
  - gas is mostly empty space
  - molecules collide with others or walls
  - no intermolecular forces, other than collisions
  - molecules gain or lose energy during elastic collisions, but net energy remains constant
- translational kinetic energy: `ek = (1/2)• m • u^2` (`u` is velocity)
- frequency of collision: `f ∝ u • (N / V)`
- momentum transfer to wall: `µ ∝ m • u`
- Gas pressure: `P ∝ µ • f ∝ (m•u)•u•(N/V) ∝ mu^2•(N/V)`
- then, assuming all molecules have the same speed, we can approximate: `P = (1/3)mu^2(N/V)`, where u is the rms speed

### Liquids and Solutions
- phase is a region of uniform properties
- at phase equilibrium there is no net conversion from one phase to another
- vapour pressure is the pressure at phase equilibrium, independent of the size of the system and correlative with temp/boiling point
- h2o forms partial dipoles and water forms tetrahedral shapes of 5 molecules, O is partial negative
- vapour pressure
- Antoine's equation for Pvap: `log Pvap = A - B/(C+T)`, where A, B, C are constants; properties of a substance
- heat is necessary to accomplish phase transition
  - the heat is measured at constant pressure called enthalpy
- Clausius-Clapeyron equation for Pvap is correlation between Pvap to tempurature
  - `ln(Pvap2/Pvap1) = delta Hvap/R • (1/T1 - 1/T2)`
- phase diagrams graph Pressure vs. Temperature, showing the state of a compound for a given temp and pressure 

### Henry's Law
Ideal solutions are ones where solvent and solute do not interact with each other

Henry's law applies to gas-liquid solutions
- relates partial pressure of gas (solute) to its molar fraction in the liquid (solvent):
- `Pi = ki•xi`, ki is Henry's law constant, and depends on solute,solvent,temp
- important for calculating solubility, `xi`

### Raoult's Law
Relates partial pressure of a gas to its vapour pressure in liquid/liquid and liquid/solid solutions: `Pi = xi•Pvap,i`

### Boiling Point Elevation
Normal boiling point of a pure liquid is the temp at which Pvap = 1atm
