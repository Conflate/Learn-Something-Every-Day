# ECE 124
## Pre Midterm: Combinational Circuits (Part 1)
- boolean algebra
- switching algebra
- k-maps

## Post Midterm: Sequential Systems (Part 2)
- edge-triggered vs latch-triggered
- flip-flops can store data by feeding their outputs into its input
 
### Simplification
- # of gates
- # of levels of logic
- # of states & # of flip-flops

### Analysis and Design of Synchronous Sequential Systems
Start with informal specification of desired system

1. Formalize system with state diagram. Reduce state diagram by merging equivilant states. State Assignment.
2. State Table. 
  - add flip-flop inputs, referring to the excitation table
  - Draw K-maps for flip-flop inputs & system outputs
3. Draw circuit diagram

### Resistors and Counters
- Shift registers
  - serial adder
  - multiplexer add functionality
- Counters
  - ripple counters (no clock)
  - synchronous counters
  
### Memory & Programmable logic devices
- Read Only Memory has fixed AND array and programmable OR array
- Programmable array logic
- fixed OR array & programmable AND array
- Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA) both arrays programmable

### Asynchronous Sequential Circuits
Brief


# MATH 119
## Pre midterm
- Taylor Series
 - Taylor polynomials and Taylor's Inequality
 - Big O suste,
- Basic Series
 - sinx = sum((-1)^k * x^(2k+1)) / (2k+1)!
 - cosx = sum((-1)^k * x^(2k)) / (2k)!
 - e^x = sum (x^k/k!)
 - 1/(1-x)
- Convergence of infinite series 
- Power series
 - Radius and Interval of Convergence (when the power series converges to the exact value of the function)
 - Manipulation of power series (integrate, differentiate, divide by x)
 - Multiplying power series is messy without Big O

## Post Midterm
- Graphing scalar fields (don't worry about level curves and cross sections)
- Partial derivatives (fx, fy, fxx, fxy, fyy)
- Two-variable Taylor Series with linear approximation (tangent plane)
- Differentials
- Parametric Equations (vector fields, vector functions)
