# Database Management Systems
## Chapter 1: Intro
A **DBMS** is a very large integrated collection of data
- is a software package designed to store and manage databases
- can have DSLs for better queries than regular file systems
- DBMS must protect data from inconsistency due to multiple concurrent users
- they offer crash recovery, security and access control

### Data Models
- a **data model** is a collection of concepts for describing data
- a **schema** is a description of a particular collection of data, for a given data model
  - conceptual schema defines logical structure
  - physical schema describes files and indexes
  - external describes views
- relational model of data uses relations (tables with rows and columns), where every relation has a schema describing columns and fields
